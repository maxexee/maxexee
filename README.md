- Originally from the strawberry capital of the world, Irapuato, Gto, Mexico.

- **GNU/Linux's** follower, my heart and two of my three computers belong to it 100%.
  However, sometimes it is necessary to use private operating systems.

- Likewise, if it were up to me, I would like all the projects I have developed and will develop to be 
  free and/or Open Source, but nothing in this life is free and sometimes you have to keep the software 
  private and under license. The bills **NOT** pay for themselves!

- Passionate about computer security (Love malwares), but now it's more like a hobby.

- Learning **chess** will open your mind, it will make you see more variants in all aspects of life.
  The more information the better decisions (I'm not as good as I was in college, but it helps).

- Since high school I have been interested in electricity, and maybe my first business will be related to that 
  (if everything goes well).

- I would like to write this in Spanish, but being honest, English the universal language and all the people use it.

- A few years ago I was hopping to move to a first world country, but once I grew up, I realize that **Mexico** really is the opportunities country and **here** is where my people are, sooo...


### ¡¡Viva México, cabrones!!
### ¡¡No te rajes Guanajuato!!
